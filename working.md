# Changes That I am looking to make before 0.1

- [ ] Actually Clean Up Dropped Watchers
- [ ] Update Watcher based on current watchers' settings
- [ ] Refactor backend / task code 
  - [ ] consider publishing a subset of the task code behind a feature toggle to
      allow for task to be driven within other event loop.
